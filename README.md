MyVirtualKeyboard
MyVirtualKeyboard is a Java Swing application that simulates a virtual keyboard. As users type on their physical keyboard, the corresponding keys on the virtual keyboard highlight.

Usage
Compile and run MyVirtualKeyboard.java:

javac MyVirtualKeyboard.java
java MyVirtualKeyboard
The application will launch a window displaying an information label, a text area for typing, and a virtual keyboard.

Features
Highlights keys on the virtual keyboard as you type on your physical keyboard.
Accommodates special keys like Shift, Enter, Caps, and Space.
Provides a JTextArea for typing and observing the effect on the virtual keyboard.
Note
Both classes are standalone and serve as educational materials for handling keyboard events and dynamic updates in Swing. Feel free to experiment, enhance, and integrate these classes into larger projects.
